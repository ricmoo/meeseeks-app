      <h1>Welcome to meeseeks.app!</h1>
      <p>
        This is still very much a work in progress, but we will try to get
        this <i>About Us</i> page filled with all sorts of useful details
        as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://meeseeks.app">meeseeks.app</a> service uses a
        simple static file, hosted on a CDN designed to allow websites to
        easily and safely host simple websites from IPFS, optionally using
        ENS to provide a more human-friendly name, than an IPFS multihash.
      </p>
      <h2>What is IPFS?</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://ipfs.io">Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS)</a> is a
        large, distributed and decentralized storage service, which allows anyone
        to freely publish content. Anyone may run a node and contribute to the
        system, which is where the storage comes from, people around the world
        dedicating a small portion of their computer's hard drive and bandwidth
        to the network as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content is addressed by the actual contents, so a file with the
        same contents, has the same "multihash" (think filename). This means
        if your neighbour recently watched a cat video on YouTube, they likely
        still have a copy, so when you want to watch it, it could be easily
        downloaded from your computer, trustlessly through the multihash,
        instead of going all the way to your ISP, then to their ISP and 18
        hops later, reach google, for the long trip back.
      </p>
      <h2>What is ENS?</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://ens.domains">Ethereum Naming System (ENS)</a> is a
        Smart Contract and eco-system built on top of the
        <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> blockchain, which allows
        anyone to trustlessly purchase a name, which can be thought of a bit like
        a Domain Name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have an ENS name, no one can take it away or censor you, and it
        can be used to trustless associate any information about you that you wish.
      </p>
      <h2>How does meeseeks.app work?</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://meeseeks.app">Meeseeks App</a> website was written as
        a project for the <a href="https://github.com/status-im/CryptoLife/tree/ricloo/project">Status #cryptolife hackathon</a>
        and came in first for the "Infrastructure Track".
      </p>
      <p>
        It aims to simplify using IPFS for websites, but also improves the security
        and safety of using IPFS by providing each site with its own domain name,
        which allows your site to benefit from the decades of work that internet
        browsers have included to protect you from cross-origin attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a user accesses your website, for example <a href="https://pac-txt.meeseeks.app">pac-txt.meeseeks.app</a>,
        a static bootstrap HTML page is loaded. Everyone gets the same small bootstrap loader, which
        then performs all the lookups, downloading and verification in the users browser. The
        steps the bootstrap performs once loaded in the users browser are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the domain name (<code>location.host</code>); if it is a multihash sub-domain, skip to step 3.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, the sub-domain is converted to an ENS name (e.g. <code>pac-txt.eth</code>) and resolved against the ENS Smart Contract on Ethereum.</li>
        <li>The Multihash is fetched from IPFS; a multihash may consist of links to additional multihashes if it is a large file.</li>
        <li>Each multihash is verified against the data fetched from IPFS, and then stitched together.</li>
        <li>The bootstrap page then uses <code>document.open</code> to destory and replace itself with the content downloaded from IPFS.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Links?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Our <a href="https://github.com/ricmoo/meeseeks-app">GitHub Repository</a> contains all the code (fully open source, under the MIT license)</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> website is a great place to start learning more about IPFS</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://ens.domains">ENS Domains</a> website can help you get and set up you own ENS name</li>
